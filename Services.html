            <div class="subHeading">Responsive Website</div>
           <p>Creating a responsive website is an essential skill in today’s digital age, where users access web content on various devices like mobiles, tablets, and laptops. A well-designed responsive website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, offering an optimal viewing experience to users. I specialize in developing such responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These websites not only ensure compatibility across devices but also provide a visually appealing and functional user interface. The key features of my websites include an engaging hero section, an image display gallery, and tables for displaying structured data effectively. Whether it’s for personal blogs, small businesses, or larger organizations, these features ensure the website is user-friendly and professional.<br><br>

            The hero section is the first thing visitors see on a website, making it a crucial element for creating a strong first impression. I design hero sections that are eye-catching and convey the essence of the brand or message. The image display feature enhances visual storytelling, making the website more engaging and interactive. Using modern CSS and JavaScript techniques, I ensure that the images are optimized for various devices and load efficiently. The tables I create for data display are not only aesthetically pleasing but also fully responsive, ensuring that users can easily navigate through information regardless of the device they use.<br><br>
            
            My approach to website development involves following best practices in coding and responsiveness. With HTML, I structure the content logically, ensuring that it’s accessible and semantic. Using CSS, I style the website to make it visually appealing, applying techniques like media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling features like responsive navigation menus, image sliders, and dynamic content updates. These technologies work together to create a cohesive and functional website that adapts fluidly to changing screen dimensions.<br><br>
            
            Pricing for my responsive websites is competitive and tailored to the needs of the client. The cost varies depending on the number of pages and the complexity of the project. For a single-page responsive website, the starting price is ₹1000, which includes basic elements like a hero section, an image gallery, and a data table. For more comprehensive websites with multiple pages and advanced features, the cost can go up to ₹15000. This pricing structure ensures flexibility, catering to different budgets and project requirements. Regardless of the package chosen, I ensure high-quality work and attention to detail in every project.<br><br>
            
            My focus is not just on creating websites that look good but also on delivering websites that perform well. I pay close attention to factors like fast loading times, smooth navigation, and user engagement. Additionally, I ensure that my websites are scalable, allowing clients to add features and pages as their needs grow. By leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I aim to provide clients with websites that meet their business goals while providing an excellent user experience.<br><br>

            In conclusion, I am dedicated to creating responsive websites that stand out in terms of design and functionality. With features like hero sections, image displays, and responsive data tables, these websites are ideal for businesses and individuals looking to establish a strong online presence. With competitive pricing and a commitment to quality, I aim to deliver websites that exceed client expectations.<br><br>

            <div class="subHeading">Cloning Website UI</div>
            <p>Cloning a website UI involves replicating the design and layout of an existing website to understand its structure, enhance development skills, or create a similar interface for a different project. I approach website UI cloning by analyzing the target website's design elements, such as its layout, typography, color scheme, and interactive features. The process begins with examining the website's structure using developer tools to identify the HTML for content organization and CSS for styling. I then recreate the layout using semantic HTML to ensure accessibility and replicate the styling with CSS, including flexbox, grid, animations, and media queries for responsiveness. Attention to detail is key, as I ensure pixel-perfect accuracy by comparing the cloned version to the original. Additionally, I optimize the cloned UI for various devices, ensuring it’s responsive and functions seamlessly across screens.<br><br>

            To make my UI cloning services accessible, I offer flexible pricing based on the number of pages and the complexity of the project:

            <div class="subHeading">Mini-Games Development</div>
            <p>I offer mini-game development services to create fun, engaging, and interactive experiences using JavaScript. Mini-games like **Tic Tac Toe, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Memory Matching Games, and Number Guessing Games** are excellent additions to websites, portfolios, learning platforms, or even standalone projects.
